"""The meme bot: read Bilibili for the newest memes of each game, for you to look through.

    py surf.py                        # read Bilibili for every game, then list new phrases
    py surf.py --games cs2 dota2      # only some games (cs2, lol, valorant, dota2)
    py surf.py --videos 3             # fewer videos per game: a quick test
    py surf.py --days 3               # "new" means the last 3 days instead of 7
    py surf.py --no-fetch             # don't visit Bilibili; list again from what was read

It only reads, like a visitor who isn't logged in: it never posts, likes or replies, and it
waits between requests (bilibili.py). A run reads about 60 videos in 10 to 15 minutes; the
first run reads about twice as many (see step 2).

How it works:

    1. Find videos     Bilibili asks a visitor's search for a captcha more often than not, and
                       the bot never solves captchas. So it finds videos the way a viewer
                       does: in the related videos beside a video. For each game it starts
                       from the seeds in data/surf_sources.json and the newest videos it read
                       before, keeps following the newest videos it finds (EXPAND lists),
                       and reads the ones posted in the last DAYS days with the most danmu.
                       Only videos whose titles name the game count. The search is tried
                       too, once, and used while Bilibili answers it.
    2. Read            Read each video's danmu and hot comments into the cache folder (surf/),
                       with every sender replaced by a short hash. The first time, it also
                       reads some older videos (posted 30 to 90 days ago), so it knows what
                       people were saying before and can tell what's new.
    3. Find phrases    A phrase counts when at least MIN_PEOPLE different people use it, in at
                       least MIN_VIDEOS videos. Three kinds: a whole short danmu (绷不住了), a
                       piece of longer lines that people write on its own and not only as part
                       of a longer phrase (freedom()), and a Latin-letter word that isn't an
                       English word (yyds).
    4. New or rising   Each phrase's share of the people writing in the last DAYS days is
                       compared with its share before that: nobody used it before = new, at
                       least RISE times as common = rising. Phrases the translator already
                       knows, and everyday ones in data/surf_common.txt, are left out.
    5. Save            The phrases, with example lines and the videos they came from, go to
                       surf/candidates.json in the cache folder. Nothing is added to the
                       translator's data files.
